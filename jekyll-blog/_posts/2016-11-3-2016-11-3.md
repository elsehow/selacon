<a href="http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">RogueBasin</a>. A Roguelike is usually described as a free turn-based computer game with a strong focus on intricate gameplay and replayability, and an abstract world representation using ASCII-based display, as opposed to 3D graphics. Of course, as with any genre, there are deviations from the norm.
