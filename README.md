# selacon

a blog generated by robot (and bookmarks)

# install

first, make sure [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is installed (tested on 3.1.2)

then, 

```
git clone https://github.com/elsehow/selacon
cd selacon
npm install
```

finally, make a file called `keys.json` that looks like this:

```json
{
  "cx": [your custom google search ID for image searching - cse.google.com/cse/manage/all],
  "google-api-key": [your google developer API key],
  "pocket-api-key": [your pocket API key for getting story links - http://getpocket.com],
  "pocket-access-token": [your pocket access token ]
}
```

# use

`./update.sh`

this will build the site, without regenerating posts that have already been built.

it will also serve the jekyll blog locally, watching for updates.

the markdown source files will live in `jekyll-blog/_posts/`. you can edit them manually, if you must

the compiled static HTML site will be in `jekyll-blog/_site/`. you can `scp` just this bit up to your hosting server.
